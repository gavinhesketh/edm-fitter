# Get the repository:
git clone https://github.com/gavinhesketh/edm-fitter.git
cd edm-fitter

#Source one of the setup scripts:
# on the UCL cluster:
source ucl-setup.sh
# on a laptop:
source setup.sh

# compile:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
make install -j


#this will create the folder edm-fitter/install/bin, which should be in your path. So, go to a directory where you want to run and just:
> fitEDM_with_Blinding

# to recopile, an alias set in the setup script should take care of it:
> mkedm
